# Introduction

At Delft University of Technology, we actively support the creation and publication of Jupyter Books, providing guidance and infrastructure for both authors and readers. The following chapters will explore these tools and workflows in more detail with a focus on JB2.

Whether JB2 is the right choice for you depends on your specific needs. Below is a comparison of different templates available for creating Jupyter Books at TU Delft, a more elaborate introduction and comparison can be found [here](https://tud-jb-templates.github.io/JBtemplates/).
